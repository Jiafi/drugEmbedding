Hierarchical Embedding for Drugs

# Applications of drug embedding
* for building a drug hierarchy
* for precision prescribing i.e., predict which is the next best drug to use in a patient who has adverse effects to current drug
* for drug repositioning i.e., predict new diseases that a drug may be useful beyond its current use or indication: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039412/pdf/srep32530.pdf
* for polypharmacy side effects i.e., predict side effects when multiple drugs are given to a patient: https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/13/i457/5045770
* for predicting drug response i.e., predict how a patient will respond to a drug based on molecular data of the person (this is mainly useful in cancer in selecting chemotherapeutic drugs): https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40321.pdf
